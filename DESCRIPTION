Description: Provides a set of tools for loading, manipulating and vertically combining multiple rectangular datasets with (potentially) inconsistent structure. It provides an efficient way to automate and verify otherwise labourious/error-prone processes of: (a) loading a large number of datasets in a folder, with potentially inconsistent formats (e.g. excel/csv) (b) storing these datasets in a structured object and attaching/extracting file metadata, (c) harmonising and checking the column names and structure of each dataset (d) verifying the coverage of the set of datasets across variables and cases (e.g. over a time period or across groups).
